# The future home of spirit related commands
# Spirit will be able to:
#   - launch a console into your system
#   - start the bus event listener
#   - start the spirit http server
# All of these sub-pieces communicate through saving data
# with the persistence store and reloading it frequently
#
# There may also be a Procfile which launched and monitored
#  which starts both the message bus listener and the web
#  server
