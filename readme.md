Spirit is a ruby based home automation system.  It's the friendly ghost
that controls your house, automatically turns devices on and off, and
reacts to other changs in the environment.

I aim for it to be a reliable, extendable, well designed open source
project.

Right now it's just some ideas.  I would love feedback or encouragement.
